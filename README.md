# RWSDK VS Code Theme ðŸŒ²

![]()

A Visual Studio Code theme for developers that like to write code quickly. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and optimized with sparkle and shine. âœ¨

2. Launch it
3. Choose **Extensions** from menu

5. Click Install to install it

```json

  "[RWSDK]": {
    "activityBar.background": "#000C1D",
    "activityBar.border": "#102a44",
    "editorGroup.border": "#102a44",

    "activityBar.background": "#000C1D",
    "activityBar.border": "#102a44",
    "editorGroup.border": "#102a44",
    "sideBar.background": "#001122",
    "sideBar.border": "#102a44",
    "sideBar.foreground": "#8BADC1"
  }
},
```

## Preferences shown in the preview

The font in the preview image is Dank Mono, [available here](https://dank.sh/). Editor settings to activate font ligatures:

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "Dank Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

The preview image is using [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer), a really cool extension that highlights matching brackets. This can help reduce unwanted errors.

I use this setting:

```json
"bracketPairColorizer.forceIterationColorCycle": true,
```

## Acknowledgements

This theme stands on the shoulders on those that have gone before me, borrowing from [Wes Bos's Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) and [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl theme.](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)
