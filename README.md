# RWSDK Light Theme ðŸŒ²

![](https://github.com/redwoodjs/rwsdk-light-ide-theme/blob/main/images/rwsdk-light-theme.png?raw=true)

The RWSDK Light Theme brings RedwoodSDK's warm, earthy branding into your coding environment. With its signature orange (#e47947), rich earth tones, and cream background (#FFFAF3), this theme delivers excellent readability while reducing eye strain during long coding sessions. Perfect for developers who want their VS Code to reflect RedwoodSDK's distinctive brand identity without sacrificing productivity.

## Acknowledgements

This theme stands on the shoulders on those that have gone before me, borrowing from [Wes Bos's Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) and [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl theme.](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)
